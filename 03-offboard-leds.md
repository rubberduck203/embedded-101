# Exercise: Offboard LEDs

Now that we know how to blink the on-board led on Pin13, bust out your breadboard and wire up a led to a different pin and use the [datasheets](./README.md#Datasheets) to update the hello world code accordingly.

This time, we'll vary the on/off time so we can note how wiring the LED differently changes the programâ€™s behavior.

```c
int main(void)
{
   //initialize

   for(;;)
   {
       //light on
       _delay_ms(500);
       //light off
       _delay_ms(1000);
   }
}
```
